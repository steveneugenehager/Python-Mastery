# Alternatively, docstrings (triple-quoted strings) are sometimes used for multiline 
# comments, especially for documentation purposes, but they are technically string 
# literals. If not assigned or used as documentation, they are ignored at runtime.
#      In Python, docstrings are special string literals used to document modules, classes,
# functions, or methods. They are enclosed in triple quotes (''' or """) and are placed 
# as the first statement inside these definitions.
# Purpose of docstrings:
#  - To describe what the module, class, function, or method does.
#  - To provide documentation that can be accessed programmatically.
