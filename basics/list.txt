In Python, a list is a mutable, ordered collection of items that can contain elements of different types (numbers, strings, other lists, etc.).

Key features of lists:
    - Ordered: Items have a specific order and can be accessed by index.
    - Mutable: You can change, add, or remove elements after creation.
    - Heterogeneous: Items can be of different data types within the same list.

Common operations:
    - Access elements by index:     my_list[0] → 1
    - Change elements:              my_list[1] = "banana"
    - Append items:                 my_list.append("new item")
    - Remove items:                 (by index) del my_list[2]                     or by value my_list.remove(3.14)
    - Length of the list:           len(my_list)


Python code:

# define with square brackets:
my_list = []
my_list = [ obj , ...]

# define with list() function
empty_list = list()
list_from_tuple = list( (1, 2, 3) )

>>> type( list () )
<class 'list'>
