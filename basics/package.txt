In Python, a package is a way to organize related modules into a directory hierarchy, making it easier to manage large codebases.

Key points:
    - A package is a directory that contains modules (Python files with .py extension) and a special file named __init__.py.
    - The __init__.py file indicates that the directory is a package (in Python versions earlier than 3.3). 
            In newer versions, the file is optional, but it's still commonly used.

Example Structure:

my_package/
│
├── __init__.py
├── module1.py
└── module2.py

To use modules from the package, you import them with dot notation:

import my_package.module1
from my_package import module2

Purpose:
    - Packages help organize code into logical units.
    - They prevent naming conflicts by providing a namespace.
