I wondered what Python did when comparing arithmetically numbers to null (None).

Interestingly, there is no behavior to be understood.  Exception is raised for any inequality:

>>> x = 1
>>> y = None
>>> x  < y
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<python-input-15>", line 1, in <module>
    x  < y
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'NoneType'

>>> x == y
False

>>> x != y
True



>>> a = None
>>> b = None
>>> a == b
True

>>> a != b
False
