    An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows 
different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods, 
data formats, and conventions for requesting and exchanging information.

In simple terms:
    - Think of an API as a messenger that lets one program interact with another.
    - It provides a set of functions or endpoints that developers can use to access features or data from a service or application.

Example:
    - When you use a weather app, it often gets weather data by calling an API provided by a weather service.
    - When you fetch data from a website using a web API, you make requests (like GET or POST) to specific URLs, 
        and the API responds with data (often in JSON format).

Types of APIs:
    - Web APIs: Used over the internet, like Twitter API, Google Maps API.
    - Library or Framework APIs: Provided by software libraries to access specific functions.
