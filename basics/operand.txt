In Python programming, an operand is a data value or variable that operators work with during an expression.

Explanation:
- Operand is the value or variable on which an operator performs an operation.
- In an expression like 3 + 5, both 3 and 5 are operands, and + is the operator.

#Python code:
a = 10
b = 20
result = a + b
# Here, a and b are operands, and + is the operator.
