    Unit testing is a software testing method where individual parts of a program, 
called units (such as functions, methods, or classes), are tested separately to 
ensure they work correctly.

Key points:
    - Focuses on small, isolated pieces of code.
    - Helps catch bugs early in the development process.
    - Usually automated, meaning tests are written as code and run automatically.
