In Python, a sequence is an ordered collection of items that can be accessed by their position (index).
 Sequences support operations like indexing, slicing, and iteration.

Common sequence types in Python include:

- List (list): Mutable, ordered collection of items. Example: [1, 2, 3]
- Tuple (tuple): Immutable, ordered collection. Example: (a, b, c)
- String (str): Immutable sequence of characters. Example: "hello"
- Range (range): Immutable sequence of numbers, often used in loops. Example: range(0, 10)


Features of sequences:
- Items can be accessed by index (e.g., list[0])
- Support slicing to get subsets (e.g., list[1:3])
- Can be iterated over with loops
- Support len() to find the number of items

Summary:
A sequence is an ordered collection of elements that can be accessed and manipulated based on their position in the collection.
