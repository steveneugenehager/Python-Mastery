assert is a statement in Python used for debugging and testing. It checks whether a condition is True. If the condition is False, assert raises an AssertionError exception, optionally displaying a message.


Example:

x = 5
assert x > 0  # Passes, because x > 0

assert x < 0, "x should be negative"  # Raises AssertionError with message

>>> x = 5
>>> assert x < 0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<python-input-95>", line 1, in <module>
    assert x < 0
           ^^^^^
AssertionError


How it works:
    - If the condition evaluates to True, the program continues as normal.
    - If False, an AssertionError is raised, which can help catch bugs early.

Typical use case:
    - To verify assumptions or invariants in code, especially during development.
