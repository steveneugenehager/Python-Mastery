ALIASES
**************

in Python, you can import a specific function from a module and give it an alias (a different name) using the as keyword.

For example:

from math import sqrt as square_root
print(square_root(16))

This imports the sqrt() function from the math module and assigns it the alias square_root. 
You can then use square_root() instead of sqrt().

Why use aliases?
- To shorten long function names.  (I don't think this is a good practice.)
- To avoid name conflicts.
- To improve clarity in your code.
