Conditional operators in Python are used to perform logical comparisons and make decisions in the code. 
They evaluate expressions and return True or False.

!=	        equal to	                x != y	True if x does not equal y
>	        Greater than	            x > y	True if x is greater than y
<	        Less than	                x < y	True if x is less than y
>=	        Greater than or equal to	x >= y	True if x is >= y
<=	        Less than or equal to	    x <= y	True if x is <= y
