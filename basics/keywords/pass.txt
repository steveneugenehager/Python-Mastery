The "pass" statement
********************

   pass_stmt: "pass"

"pass" is a null operation \u2014 when it is executed, nothing happens. It
is useful as a placeholder when a statement is required syntactically,
but no code needs to be executed, for example:

   def f(arg): pass    # a function that does nothing (yet)

   class C: pass       # a class with no methods (yet)



Might use this when catching an error with 'except' where you are
just wanting to avoid a program crash, but not actually do anything 
about the exception.


try:
    something()
except SomeError:
    pass
