In Python, the keyword match is used as part of the match statement, 
introduced in Python 3.10, for structural pattern matching. It allows you to 
compare a value against multiple patterns in a cleaner, more expressive 
way than chained if-elif-else statements.

match value:
    case pattern1:
        # code if pattern1 matches
    case pattern2:
        # code if pattern2 matches
    case _:
        # default case if no patterns match

# example with more specifics
command = input("Enter command (start, stop): ")
match command:
    case "start":
        print("Starting the process.")
    case "stop":
        print("Stopping the process.")
    case _:
        print("Unknown command.")
