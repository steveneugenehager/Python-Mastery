help command can be used for built-in functions and classes...

Note:
For keywords like def, if, while, you can pass them as strings to help().
For functions or objects (e.g., len), pass the function name without quotes:

Examples:

>>> help(abs)
Help on built-in function abs in module builtins:

abs(x, /)
    Return the absolute value of the argument.

>>> help('for')
The "for" statement
*******************

The "for" statement is used to iterate over the elements of a sequence
(such as a string, tuple or list) or other iterable object:

   for_stmt: "for" target_list "in" starred_expression_list ":" suite
             ["else" ":" suite]

The "starred_expression_list" expression is evaluated once; it should
yield an *iterable* object. An *iterator* is created for that
iterable. The first item provided by the iterator is then assigned to
the target list using the standard rules for assignments (see
Assignment statements), and the suite is executed. This repeats for
each item provided by the iterator. When the iterator is exhausted,
the suite in the "else" clause, if present, is executed, and the loop
terminates.

A "break" statement executed in the first suite terminates the loop
without executing the "else" clause\u2019s suite.  A "continue" statement
executed in the first suite skips the rest of the suite and continues
with the next item, or with the "else" clause if there is no next
item.

The for-loop makes assignments to the variables in the target list.
This overwrites all previous assignments to those variables including
those made in the suite of the for-loop:

   for i in range(10):
       print(i)
       i = 5             # this will not affect the for-loop
                         # because i will be overwritten with the next
                         # index in the range

Names in the target list are not deleted when the loop is finished,
but if the sequence is empty, they will not have been assigned to at
all by the loop.  Hint: the built-in type "range()" represents
immutable arithmetic sequences of integers. For instance, iterating
"range(3)" successively yields 0, 1, and then 2.

Changed in version 3.11: Starred elements are now allowed in the
expression list.

>>> help(int)
Help on class int in module builtins:

class int(object)
 |  int([x]) -> integer
 |  int(x, base=10) -> integer
 |
 |  Convert a number or string to an integer, or return 0 if no arguments
 |  are given.  If x is a number, return x.__int__().  For floating-point
 |  numbers, this truncates towards zero.
 |
 |  If x is not a number or if base is given, then x must be a string,
 |  bytes, or bytearray instance representing an integer literal in the
 |  given base.  The literal can be preceded by '+' or '-' and be surrounded
 |  by whitespace.  The base defaults to 10.  Valid bases are 0 and 2-36.
 |  Base 0 means to interpret the base from the string as an integer literal.
 |  >>> int('0b100', base=0)
 |  4
