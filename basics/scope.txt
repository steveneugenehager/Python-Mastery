    Scope in Python refers to the region or context in a program where a variable is 
accessible or can be used. It determines where a variable can be referenced or modified.

Types of scope in Python:
-Local scope:
    Variables defined inside a function are only accessible within that function.

-Global scope:
    Variables defined outside any function, accessible throughout the module (file).

-Enclosing (nonlocal) scope:
    Variables in the nearest enclosing function scope, used in nested functions.

-Built-in scope:
    Names of Python's built-in functions and constants (like len, max, etc.).

Key points:
    - Variables defined inside a function are local.
    - Variables defined outside are global.
    - You can access global variables inside functions unless shadowed by local variables.

Summary:
    Scope defines where variables are accessible in your program, controlling their visibility and lifetime during code execution.
