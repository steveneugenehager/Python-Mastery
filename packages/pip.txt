pip is the package installer for Python. It allows you to easily install, upgrade, and manage third-party 
Python packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and other repositories.

What pip does:
    - Install packages: e.g., pip install requests
    - Upgrade packages: e.g., pip install --upgrade numpy
    - Uninstall packages: e.g., pip uninstall package_name
    - List installed packages: e.g., pip list
    - Show package details: e.g., pip show package_name
