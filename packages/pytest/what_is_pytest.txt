    PyTest is a popular testing framework for Python that makes it easy to write and run tests
 for your code. It helps you check that your programs work correctly by running test
 functions and providing clear, detailed reports.

What PyTest does:
    - Lets you write simple test functions using assert statements.
    - Automatically discovers and runs tests in your project.
    - Supports fixtures, setup/teardown, parameterized tests, and more.
    - Provides helpful error messages when tests fail.
