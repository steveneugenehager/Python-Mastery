Title:  Harvard CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python – Full University Course

Summary: 
    Learn Python programming from Harvard University.  It dives more deeply into the design and 
implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Django, React, 
and Bootstrap. Topics include database design, scalability, security, and user experience. You 
will learn how to write and use APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like 
GitHub and Heroku.

This course will teach you how to read and write code as well as how to test and “debug” it. It 
is designed for students with or without prior programming experience who’d like to learn Python 
specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh my!); variables and types; 
conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, 
and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; 
model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files. 
Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by real-world programming problems. 
No software required except for a web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac.

Whereas CS50x (the original CS50 course) itself focuses on computer science more generally as well
as programming with C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, this course, aka CS50P, is entirely focused 
on programming with Python. You can take CS50P before CS50x, during CS50x, or after CS50x. But 
for an introduction to computer science itself, you should still take CS50x!
