In Python, most data types that are objects have methods—functions associated with the data
 type that allow you to perform operations or get information about the object.

Common data types with methods include:

-String (str): Methods like .lower(), .upper(), .strip(), .split(), .replace().
-List (list): Methods like .append(), .remove(), .sort(), .pop(), .extend().
-Dictionary (dict): Methods like .keys(), .values(), .items(), .get(), .update().
-Tuple (tuple): Mainly immutable, but has methods like .count() and .index().
-Set (set): Methods like .add(), .remove(), .union(), .intersection().
-Integer (int) and Float (float): Limited methods, mainly for conversions and comparisons, e.g., .bit_length() for integers.
-Boolean (bool): Methods like .bit_length() (since bool is a subclass of int).

Note: Primitive data types like int, float, and bool have limited methods, as they 
are immutable and simpler compared to container types like lists and strings.

In summary:
Data types that are objects (like strings, lists, dictionaries, sets) have methods 
that you can call to manipulate or get information about the data.
